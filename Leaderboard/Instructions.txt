Setup:
    to use this package, you need to create an account on lootlocker.com
    create a game and setup a leaderboard to use guest login or steam
    in the leaderboard settings window or leaderboard settings asset
    add your game key and leaderboard id and platform
Use:
    create a game object for your leaderboard behavior and add a leaderboard behavior script
    
    use the leaderboard behavior player property to set player with new DataContainer.PlayerData()
    or a saved DataContainer.PlayerData()
    
    with a player created, you can start a session using LeaderboardBehavior.StartSession()
    starting a session fills the player data container with a session token and member id
    
    after starting a session, you can use LeaderboardBehavior.SubmitScore() to send scores
    use LeaderboardBehavior.SetName() will save the player's name with their profile
    
    LeaderboardBehavior.GetTopPlayersLeaderboardList() gets a list of size [leaderboard range]
    starting at rank one
    
    LeaderboardBehavior.GetPlayerLeaderboardList() gets list based around the currently set player
    it puts the set player as the middle rank of retrieved leaderboard (if the player's rank greater than
    the leaderboard range, half the range will be subtracted from the rank and the returned list will start at that rank)
    to get different players ranks set leaderboard behavior player and if the player has no session token start a session
